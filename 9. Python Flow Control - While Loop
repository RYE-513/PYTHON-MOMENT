WHILE LOOP - The while loop executes a group of statements as long the given expressions is 'True'

"""
Syntax:

while expression:
	statement(s)
	var++ # without this 'increment' your program will print endlessly
"""
____________
WHILE LOOP 1
____________

i = 0

while i < 5:
	print(i) # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
	i += 1 # this is increment adding 1
____________
WHILE LOOP 2
____________

i = 1

while i <= 5:
	print('RYE BSCS') # print this 'RYE BSCS' 5 times.
	i += 1

# If you direct " while 0 < 5: " it will raised an error

while 0 < 5:
	print(i)
	i += 1
____________
WHILE LOOP 3
____________

i = 0

while i < 5:
	print(i) # If you don't put increment 'i += 1' in while loop it will run endlessly

ELSE WITH FOR LOOP
__________________

i = 1

while i <= 5:
	print('RYE BSCS') # print this 5 times then...
	i += 1
else:
	print('Loop has ended') # it will print at the end.
