# Create a function that censors profanity. Each occurence of profanity in the input text should replaced with "****", then the new text should be returned

def cleanText(ctext, censorList) :
    # Your function should replace all censored words in the text with '****'
    pass # replace 'pass' with your funtion content

theText = "A baby donkey is called an ass nigga not an idiot!"
theCensorList = ["ass", "nigga", "idiot"]

print(cleanText(theText, theCensorList))
# Output should be "A baby donkey is called an **** **** not an ****!"

# HINT: You can create a loop that goes through all words in the censorList, for each censored word, replace every occurence of that word in your text with '****'
