• used to check whether a sequence or value is present in an object or not

rye = 20

list1 = [10,20,30]
list2 = [10,20,30]

print(rye in list1)  # true: 'in' consider as 'true' but 'is' consider as 'false' which is vice versa.
print(list1 in list2) # false: yes they are both same values, but they are different object 'variable name'.
print(list1 == list2) # true: same equal value
