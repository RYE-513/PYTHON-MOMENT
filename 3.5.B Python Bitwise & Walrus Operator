**BINARY AND (&)**

a = 50		# 110010
b = 25		# 011001
c = a & b	# 010000
print(c) # 16

"""
EXPLANATION:
a = 50 convert into binary - 110010 
b = 25 convert into binary - 011001
c = a & b added the a and b -  010000 is equivalent to 16

1 + 1 = 1
0 + 0 = 0
1+ 0 = 0
0+ 1 = 0
"""

**BINARY RIGHT SHIFT (>>)**

x = 240		# 11110000
y = x >> 2 # 00111100
print(y)

"""
EXPLANATION:

x = 240 convert into binary - 11110000
y = x >> 2 the ">>" means right shift and it means the 2 corresponds to add 2 zeros on FIRST digits '11110000' become '00111100' and the last 2 zero's will removed
print(y)  '00111100' is equivalent to '60'
"""
*OTHER EXAMPLE*

x = 180		# 10110100
y = x >> 3 # 00010110
print(y) # 22

x = 347 # 101011011
y = x >> 5 # 000001010
print(y) # 10

**BINARY LEFT SHIFT (<<)**

x = 56 # 111000
y = x << 2 # 111000'00'
print(y) # 480

"""
EXPLANATION:

x = 56 convert into binary - 111000
y = x << 2 the "<<" means left shift and it means the 2 corresponds to add 2 zeros on LAST digits '111000' become '11100000'
print(y)  '11100000' is equivalent to '224'

Binary Right Shift - added zero on a first digit and the last digit will removed with the number of added on a first digit
